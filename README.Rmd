```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm <- readRDS(here::here("bench", "timings.Rds"))
library(dplyr)
tbl <- tm %>% dplyr::filter(type == "real", op == "read", package != "vroom_dplyr") %>%
  mutate(package = sub("_base", "", package)) %>%
  transmute(
    package = package,
    "time (sec)" = time,
    speedup = max(time) / time,
    "throughput" = prettyunits::pretty_bytes(size / time))
```

The fastest delimited reader for R, **`r dplyr::filter(tbl, package == "vroom") %>% pull("throughput") %>% paste0("/sec")`**.

But that's impossible! How can it be [so fast](https://jimhester.github.io/vroom/articles/benchmarks/benchmarks.html)?

vroom doesn't stop to actually _read_ all of your data, it simply indexes where
each record is located so it can be read later. The vectors returned use the
[Altrep framework](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html) to
lazily load the data on-demand when it is accessed, so you only pay for what
you use.

vroom uses multiple threads for indexing and materializing non-character
vectors, to further improve performance.

However it has no (current) support for windows newlines, comments, or other
niceties which can slow down and complicate parsing.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(tbl, digits = 2)
```

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jimhester/vroom")
```
## Example

```{r, include = FALSE}
tibble::rownames_to_column(mtcars, "model") %>%
  write.table(sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, file = "mtcars.tsv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r example}
vroom::vroom("mtcars.tsv")
```

## Benchmarks

The speed quoted above is from a dataset with 14,776,615 rows and 11 columns,
see the [benchmark
article](https://jimhester.github.io/vroom/articles/benchmarks/benchmarks.html)
for details.

## Thanks

- [Gabe Becker](https://twitter.com/groundwalkergmb), [Luke
  Tierney](https://stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/) and [Tomas Kalibera](https://github.com/kalibera) for
  implementing and maintaining the [Altrep
  framework](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html)
- [Romain Fran√ßois](https://twitter.com/romain_francois), whose
  [Altrepisode](https://purrple.cat/blog/2018/10/14/altrep-and-cpp/) package
  and [related blog-posts](https://purrple.cat/blog/2018/10/14/altrep-and-cpp/) were a great guide for creating new Altrep objects in C++.
- [Matt Dowle](https://twitter.com/mattdowle) and the rest of the [Rdatatable](https://github.com/Rdatatable) team, `data.table::fread()` is blazing fast and great motivation!
